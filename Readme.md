To-Do List Project :
Overview ->
This project is a simple, web-based To-Do List application. It allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Project Structure :
HTML ->
The HTML file (index.html) provides the structure of the web application. It includes:

*A container that holds the input field and button for adding new tasks.
*An unordered list (ul) where the tasks will be displayed.
*References to the CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.

CSS ->
The CSS file (styles.css) is responsible for the visual styling of the application. Key elements styled include:

*The overall layout and design, including fonts and colors.
*The input fields and buttons, ensuring they are visually appealing and user-friendly.
*The task list items, including hover effects and button styles.

JavaScript ->
The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the application's functionality, including:

*Adding new tasks to the list.
*Editing existing tasks.
*Deleting tasks.
*Saving tasks to localStorage to ensure data persistence.
*Retrieving and displaying tasks from localStorage when the page loads.

Usage :
1. Adding a New Task:

*Enter a task in the input box provided at the top of the page.
*Click the "Add" button or press the "Enter" key.
*The new task will be added to the list and saved in localStorage.

2. Editing a Task:

*Click the "Edit" button next to the task you want to change.
*The task text will appear in the input box, and the "Add" button will change to "Edit".
*Modify the task text as needed, then click "Edit" or press "Enter" to save the changes.

3. Deleting a Task:

*Click the "Remove" button next to the task you want to delete.
*The task will be removed from the list and deleted from localStorage.

Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future improvements:

*Priority Levels: Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
*Due Dates: Add the ability to set and display due dates for tasks.
*Categories/Tags: Enable users to categorize or tag tasks for better organization.
*Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to quickly find tasks.
*Sort and Filter: Allow tasks to be sorted and filtered based on various criteria such as priority, due date, or category.
*Responsive Design: Improve the design to ensure it is fully responsive and works well on all device sizes.
*User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to maintain separate to-do lists.
*Sync Across Devices: Enable synchronization of tasks across multiple devices using a backend server or cloud service.
